create datamart database and tables with datamart schema and proper types
create synonyms  on staging tables

Change staging SSIS packages to take the procedure parameters from variables.

Before data are loaded to datamart tables they should be checked on valid data types. It could be done in procedure or in ssis package

create procedures for incremental load

SCD 1 - slowly changing dimmention Type 1
ReturnDetails 
Payments 
FeedbackDetails  
Discounts 
DeliveryDetails 

SCD 2 - slowly changing dimmention Type 2

DimSuppliers 
DimProducts 
DimLocations 
DimGaranties 
DimClients  

Write stored procedure for populating fact tables: 
	*FactDeliveries from DimClients, DimDeliveryDetails, DimProducts, DimDates, DimLocation
	*FactReturns from DimReturndetails, DimProducts, DimPayments, DimGaranties, DimDates
	*FactOrders from  DimPayments, DimDeliveryDetails, DimGaranties, DimClients, DimDiscounts, DimReturndetails, DimDates, DimProducts
	*FactSupplies from DimDates, DimLocation, DimSupliers, DimProducts
	*FactFeedbacks from DimProducts, DimFeedbackDetails, DimDates, DimClients

create ssis packages for calling datamart procedures
